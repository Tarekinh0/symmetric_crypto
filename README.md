# symmetric_crypto
This program allows you to encrypt your data using a system almost identical to the AES technology.
Simply launch the program, provide it with the target file and set up a key (or password). 
Then, once you want to see your data, target the file and provide the password.

You can find a doxygen documentation  in the repository. The role of each and every function is explained with details.
A report was also written and is available in the repository. It helps understand the theory behind the program.
